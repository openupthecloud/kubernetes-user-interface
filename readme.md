## Kubernetes User Interface

1. Login to AWS `./scripts/aws-auth.sh`
2. Copy to `/workspace/kubernetes-user-interface/backend/config.yml` a Kubernetes configuration

## Vision

1. I tried some existing Kubernetes dashboards e.g. https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/
    * Overall, not bad, but wanted something
2. I tried EKS dashboard, but it was really painful
3. I tried the kubctl CLI, but it's too much effort, okay for actions, not good for overviews
- I also wanted something I could self-host deploy, and easily hook up to a cluster
    * Kinda like building my own "PaaS" UI over EKS

Challenges I had: 

1. Too much Kubernetes specifics, as a developer I want signal/noise
    * I don't care about Node/Cluster specifics, but I might if I need to debug
1. Bouncing about between EKS dashboard and UI in Backstage
